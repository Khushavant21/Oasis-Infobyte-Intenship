            <p id="img-caption">Elon Musk, (born June 28, 1971, Pretoria, South Africa), South African-born American
                entrepreneur who cofounded the electronic-payment firm PayPal and formed SpaceX, maker of launch
                vehicles and spacecraft. He was also one of the first significant investors in, as well as chief
                executive officer of, the electric car manufacturer Tesla. In addition, Musk acquired Twitter in 2022.

            <h1>Tesla</h1>
            <p>Musk had long been interested in the possibilities of electric cars, and in 2004 he became one of the
                major funders of Tesla Motors (later renamed Tesla), an electric car company founded by entrepreneurs
                Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. In 2006 Tesla introduced its first car, the Roadster, which could
                travel 245 miles (394 km) on a single charge. Unlike most previous electric vehicles, which Musk thought
                were stodgy and uninteresting, it was a sports car that could go from 0 to 60 miles (97 km) per hour in
                less than four seconds. In 2010 the company’s initial public offering raised about $226 million. Two
                years later Tesla introduced the Model S sedan, which was acclaimed by automotive critics for its
                performance and design. The company won further praise for its Model X luxury SUV, which went on the
                market in 2015. The Model 3, a less-expensive vehicle, went into production in 2017 and became the
                best-selling electric car of all time.</p>
            <h2>SpaceX</h2>
            <p>In early 2001, Musk became involved with the nonprofit Mars Society and discussed funding plans to place
                a growth-chamber for plants on Mars.[74] In October of the same year, he traveled to Moscow with Jim
                Cantrell and Adeo Ressi to buy refurbished intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that could send
                the greenhouse payloads into space. He met with the companies NPO Lavochkin and Kosmotras; however, Musk
                was seen as a novice[75] and the group returned to the United States empty-handed. In February 2002, the
                group returned to Russia with Mike Griffin (president of In-Q-Tel) to look for three ICBMs. They had
                another meeting with Kosmotras and were offered one rocket for $8 million, which Musk rejected. He
                instead decided to start a company that could build affordable rockets.[75] With $100 million of his own
                money,[76] Musk founded SpaceX in May 2002 and became the company's CEO and Chief Engineer.</p>
            <h3>Twitter</h3>
            <p>Musk joined the social media service Twitter in 2009, and, as @elonmusk, he became one of the most
                popular accounts on the site, with more than 85 million followers as of 2022. He expressed reservations
                about Tesla’s being publicly traded, and in August 2018 he made a series of tweets about taking the
                company private at a value of $420 per share, noting that he had “secured funding.” (The value of $420
                was seen as a joking reference to April 20, a day celebrated by devotees of cannabis.) The following
                month the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Musk for securities fraud, alleging that
                the tweets were “false and misleading.” Shortly thereafter Tesla’s board rejected the SEC’s proposed
                settlement, reportedly because Musk had threatened to resign. However, the news sent Tesla stock
                plummeting, and a harsher deal was ultimately accepted. Its terms included Musk’s stepping down as
                chairman for three years, though he was allowed to continue as CEO; his tweets were to be preapproved by
                Tesla lawyers, and fines of $20 million for both Tesla and Musk were levied.</p>
